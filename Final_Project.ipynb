    "Wine type is very important to many people, connoisseurs and distributors alike. The type of a wine can be a factor in determining many different things, including its value and intended purpose (when it is used). There are a multitude of factors in a wine that can contribute to its overall categorization, however we will be exploring if a wine is a red or a white based on specific qualities."

Not all wine types are presented equally. It was collected in 2009 and combines two data sets. A total of 11 measured factors of wine are present, some represented in a scale of integers and others on a continuous scale.

    "Our model had an accuracy level of 97.9 percent, which is unusually high. It is important to note why this is the case in order to understand the limitation of the model that we created. This could be due to a number of different reasons. Firstly, our dataset is limited, in the sense that there are few data points for red wine compared to the number of data for white wine. Secondly, all of the wines in our dataset are from the same vineyard, which could mean that there are differences in the chemical compounds of the grapes and soil (leading to a difference in the composition of the wine, which ultimately could change the factors we use to predict wine type). Thirdly, red wine and white wine might just have some extreme differences when it comes to Volatile Acidity, Chlorides, and Total Sulfur Dioxide – it is possible that the model may be this accurate because there truly is a noticeable difference in the levels of these variables, which makes it easy to predict wine type. This would render the model almost useless in many situations however, with more data, it is possible that a model such as this could help classify wines that are blends of white grape and red grape varieties, as more red than white, or more white than red.

    "Through our model, it is clear that these factors (Volatile Acidity, Chlorides, and Total Sulfur Dioxide) have significant differences in scale if a wine is red vs white. We found that Chlorides and Volatile Acidity are significantly higher in red wines than in white wines. We also found that Total Sulfur Dioxide is higher for white wines than for red wines. Because of this difference, our model was able to predict red wine vs white wine with 97.9% accuracy.\n",
    "This is what we expected to find, as we initially saw a large difference in the capability of these factors. Each one had clear differences between red and white wine, and we expected there to be a clear positive or negative relationship between the type of wine, and each one of these variables. "

    "Overall, we created an accurate model which predicts the type of a wine, as either red or white. This model could be used to classify blended wines with an unknown concentration of red grape vs white as a wine more red or more white. As blended wines grow in popularity, this distinction could be important to connoisseur trying to understand their wines and determine their qualities. This classification model could  also be used as a building block on which other programs are built on. For instance, if someone were to build a wine quality prediction model, this program could be linked together with that one in order to help the accuracy of results. Wine quality is judged on factors that differ for each type of wine, and using our classification model would ultimately help increase the accuracy of a new model. These are two examples of the impacts of our findings and their future, however there are many more possibilities to be built on."

    "More analysis could be done with a much larger dataset, with additional types of wines. Currently, our dataset takes wines from a certain vineyard, however taking data from different vineyards would create a more balanced dataset, and would put our model to the test. Also, due to the low number of red wines in our dataset, our model was limited in the prediction estimates of red wine – with a more even dataset, our model would be better trained and more accurate. Also, if we wanted to increase the accuracy or versatility of our model, we could use additional predictors, as this would likely make our model more accurate.\n"
